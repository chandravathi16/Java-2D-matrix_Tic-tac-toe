# Java-2D-matrix_Tic-tac-toe

- Algorithm to build Tic-tac-toe project 
  --------------------------------------
steps :
1. Create a Tic-tac-toe board and fill it dashes.
2. Ask a user to need two players to play a game.
3. Create a function that needs to print a board (9 square boxes).
4. Keep repeating the game until it false 
   	- Keep asking the user to enter row and column until they are valid.
        - Set the right position on the board with proper symbol (either 'x' or 'o').
        - Handle the conditions such as -
		- If the entered row and col are out of bounds then try again asking row,col
		- If the position of row and col already filled, then print a statement that 'made a move already!'
5. Create a function to handle the Tic-tac-toe conditions
	- If the player with row-wise 'x' or 'o' has three equal (OR) 
	- with col-wise (OR)
	-  diagonal-wise(primary/secondary diagonal) same then game wins 
6.Check if the game has ended or a tie/draw. If the board still contains spaces/'-' then game is not draw
